# Would You Rather Project

This is my code for the final assessment project for Udacity's React & Redux course.

## Instructions:

- Clone Project
- run `yarn install` followed by `yarn start`. You can alternatively use `npm install` & `npm start`

The styling is very bare minimum.. I focused on functionality for my submission.  I will definitely continue to work on this to improve it as a whole.

All requested features work as expected with the exception of my Logout functionality.  It logs you out, but with an error (Cannot read property 'dispatch' of undefined).
